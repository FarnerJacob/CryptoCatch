# CryptoCatch
This app allows me to receive notifications from a rudimentary analysis bot I built and was running for approxiamately 4 months straight. The overall goal of this app was to streamline my information feed by automating parsing through information, so I can invest accordingly to the received data. By the end of development, I could effectively trade on Bittrex and check my portfolio on both Bittrex and Binance. With school and other projects, I could not keep up with development, so I am on hiatus with plans to reformat this app by removing a few features and adding a lot more for a public release.

# Development
This app was built on React Native with a heavy focus on Android development (mainly due to lack of access to an iPhone). As such, there are many known issues with the iPhone version, but all of the issues should be minor fixes. Expo was used for their amazing XDE software as well as their push notifications. For the backend, Firebase was used to quickly get the app up and running. 

# Analysis Bot
The analysis bot was the starting point for this app. I built the analysis bot to send me texts about its alerts; however, I quickly realized that building a mobile UI would vital to its success. Not much changed with the bot after the development of this app. It still has a rudimentary analysis strategy that will definitely change after I graduate/learn some more advanced analysis techniques. It was correct most of the times on the rise of cryptocurrencies from October of 2017 to early January of 2018. After the crash of cryptocurrencies in mid January, it stopped being correct and proved that its analysis technique has much to be desired and is not a good indicator for future results.

These screenshots are taken from my phone to give an example of the working product. To be honest, the green color scheme was just something I was playing with not something I was planning on keeping. Whenever I update this app, the color scheme will be on of the first things to change.
