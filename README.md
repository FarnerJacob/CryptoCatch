# CryptoCatch
This app allows me to receive notifications from a rudimentary analysis bot I built and was running for approxiamately 4 months straight. The overall goal of this app was to streamline my information feed by automating parsing through information, so I can invest accordingly to the received data. By the end of development, I could effectively trade on Bittrex and check my portfolio on both Bittrex and Binance. With school and other projects, I could not keep up with development, so I am on hiatus with plans to reformat this app by removing a few features and adding a lot more for a public release.
